        <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
        <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist
          who served as the 11<sup>th</sup> president of India from <b><i>2002</i></b> to
          <b><i>2007</i></b>. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
          physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
          scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research
          and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
          space programme and military missile development efforts. [1] He thus
          came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
          technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          <b><i>1998</i></b>, the first since the original nuclear test by India in <b><i>1974</i></b>.
